            <h1><strong>About</strong></h1>
            <p>JobBridge was created by a group of young people who saw firsthand how many job seekers — from recent graduates to informal workers — struggle not because they lack talent, but because they lack access to valid opportunities and tools. Of the features we offer, visual job browsing, CVs built from real work feedback, and job-specific English lessons are our core tools — helping users not only navigate the process more easily, but also connect with credible, relevant job openings. We exist to make job hunting simpler, fairer, and more inclusive for people who’ve often been left out.</p>
